EPICS ADS Device Support


This device support library is used for communication with Beckhoff ADS devices.
It implements the layer between Beckhoff ADS client library and EPICS database
records. The library handles read/write requests initiated by database records
and converts them to ADS client library calls.

More information can be found in the EPICS ADS Reference Manual and Architecture
documents, located in this repository: adsApp/src/doc/
